# food sufficiency
"We sit now at only 64% self-sufficiency, having fallen from over 75% in the mid-1980"
"In 1984, there was enough food produced in Britain to feed the nation for 306 days of the year. Today, that figure is 233 days, making 21 August 2020 the day that the country would run out of food if we were relying solely on British produce."

Food security report:
The UK currently produces about 60% of its domestic food consumption by economic value, part of which is exported. This means just under half of the actual food on plates is produced in the UK, including the majority of grains, meat, dairy, and eggs. This figure would be higher without exports. UK supply comprises domestic production excluding exports, plus imported food. The production to supply ratio, important for understanding the UKâ€™s self-sufficiency, has remained stable over the last two decades, and for crops that can be commercially grown in the UK has been around 75%.
